     amk221 | has anybody got 5 minutes to help me with a weird inconsistancy I
            | found with bind-attr vs the new htmlbars if. I don't know if its a
            | bug or not
     amk221 | https://github.com/amk221/ember-cli-validation-proxy
alexspeller | amk221: I know that the htmlbars syntax works
     amk221 | alexspeller: yes. same. I know too, I've tested it in a fiddle.
            | http://jsfiddle.net/amk221/6abmn5zb/1/
     amk221 | was just asking for help on that demo. thats all
alexspeller | amk221: it's weird
     amk221 | its most definitly something stupid I'm doing (always the case!)
            | but I duno what
      locks | amk221: what makes you think that if will work?
     amk221 | locks: what do you mean?
     amk221 | have i missed something obvious?
      locks | amk221: class="thing {{if thing.isOn 'on' 'off'}}"
      locks | I mean where have you seen that syntax
     amk221 | hmm, I can't remember. I didn't pull it out of thin air. I will
            | try to find where I got it from.
     amk221 | http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/03/27/ember-1-11-0-released.html#toc_inline-if
alexspeller | amk221: locks: the syntaxs works for me
alexspeller | locks: amk221: https://jsfiddle.net/w3sj0mkt/31/
alexspeller | amk221: btw I like this design, looks like it'd make a nice addon
alexspeller | amk221: people seem to ask about this a lot
      locks | amk221: and you're sure you're on 1.11 right
      locks | amk221: your demo works for me fwiw
     amk221 | locks: ah. the fiddle does yes. But this doesn't
            | https://github.com/amk221/ember-cli-validation-proxy
      locks | Ah
     amk221 | I think the issue is not related to templating, but rather
            | somewhere between BufferedProxy and EmberValidations.
alexspeller | amk221: you're right there
alexspeller | amk221: this works fine:
            | https://gist.github.com/alexspeller/5253176a97b22024d2c2
     amk221 | hmm
alexspeller | amk221: also, making a new property in the controller like this
            | and using that in the if *does* work:   nameErrorBinding:
            | 'form.errors.name',
alexspeller | amk221: but using nameError: Em.computed.alias('form.errors.name')
            | in the controller and using that in the if *doesn't* work
     amk221 | interesting thanks for your help
alexspeller | amk221: I have no idea how to track it down further. The bug could
            | be in ember validations, the buffered proxy, or ember itself
     amk221 | stumped :)
     amk221 | I need to figure it out before bind-attr goes away
     amk221 | whats weird is, if i put {{log form.errors.name}} in the template,
            | it works
      locks | amk221: open an issue
      locks | Include the smallest repro you can and this discussion
     amk221 | locks: I would, but I'm not sure where haha!
alexspeller | amk221: I would suggest ember
      locks | ^
     amk221 | rightyho, thank you
     amk221 | cheers for looking
alexspeller | amk221: because even if there is a bug somewhere else, the
            | behaviour of that if syntax should be the same as the bind-attr
